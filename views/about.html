<p class="textShow">My name is Quentin and I'm a web developer and musician.
  For the past eight and a half years I've toured all over the world as the drummer for singer/dj/recording artist Mayer Hawthorne.  Although music has always been a huge passion of mine, the amount of time away from home was difficult. I decided it was time to persue another passion of mine, which is coding. I began the process of learning to code on my own using programs such as Codecademy to get my footing.  As time moved on I felt as though I wanted to dig deeper so I enrolled in a full time intensive coding bootcamp to get a firm coding foundation.  Grand Circus is a software engineering school based out of Downtown Detroit. The Front End/JavaScript Bootcamp was a 2 month long full-time program that taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, AngularJS, NodeJS (and npm), PostgreSQL, and more. Since graduating I've been working hard to continue learning and building on the foundation I have. I've recently been working with SCSS, learning PHP, and getting familiar with Photoshop and other Adobe Creative Suite products. Now I'm looking forward to finding a company that will allow me to share with them the unique combination of skill, self motivation, and determination I bring. </p>
